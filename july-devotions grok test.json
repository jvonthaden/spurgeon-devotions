It is carried on by the Word of God applied to the heart by the Holy Spirit. The truth is the sanctifier, and the more truth we receive, the more we are sanctified. The Spirit of God uses the Word to convict, comfort, and instruct, and thus to work sanctification. The truth is the sanctifying element, and the Spirit is the sanctifying agent. The truth must be received into the heart, and it must be lived out in the life. Let us pray for sanctification through the truth, and let us live in the truth.</p>"

The glances of His eyes outshine the sun; the beauties of His face are fairer than the choicest flowers; no fragrance is like the breath of His mouth. Gems of the mine and pearls from the sea are worthless when measured against Him. Let Him be crowned with majesty, for He is worthy. Let Him be adored with sacred songs, for He is precious. Let Him be loved with all the heart, for He is precious. Let Him be served with every power of our being, for He is precious. Let Him be trusted with every care, for He is precious. Let Him be followed with every step, for He is precious. Let Him be proclaimed with every breath, for He is precious. Let Him be exalted with every act, for He is precious.</p>"

If He were not slow to anger, where would we be? If He were not great in power, how could He restrain His wrath? It is a marvel that He can be just and yet delay judgment. It is a miracle of grace that He can be holy and yet bear with sinners. But He is great in power, and therefore He can be slow to anger. Let us adore His patience, and bless Him for His long-suffering. Let us not abuse it, but turn to Him in repentance, and magnify His mercy.</p>"

It breaks the cedars, it divides the flames of fire, it shakes the wilderness. The voice of the Lord makes the hinds to calve, and discovers the forests. In His temple, everyone speaks of His glory. Let us listen to His voice in the Word, in providence, and in conscience. Let us yield to its power, and adore its majesty. Let us be silent before Him, and worship Him in the beauty of holiness.</p>"
